# Criteria for Quality Control

Author: Marie Phelan
Revision Date: 2 November 2017

1. Shape and width of reference peak (usually TSP) Line width typically measured at half height 
2. Baseline flat without curvature or sine wiggle. 
3. Signal to noise as expected (check against representative spectrum) 
4. Water suppression good. Narrow water signal (between 0.2 and 0.4 ppm wide). No baseline distortion beyond that range. 
5. Phasing good throughout spectra
