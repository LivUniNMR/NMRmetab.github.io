# Tube Washing for NMR Metabolomics

The purpose of this protocol is to ensure NMR tubes are washed to a standard compatible with NMR metabolomics – deviations from this protocol can result in contamination of samples with detergents and solvents that will make the resultant data unusable.

## Soak/Wash

1. Soak NMR tubes and caps with decon90 from squirt bottle (10% decon90)
2. Ensure all tubes and caps are completely filled with decon90 and let it soak overnight
3. Ensure all tubes' opening are facing upright so that decon90 does not leak out

## After soaking

4. Rinse out decon90 from the NMR tubes using glass pipette (rinse does not need to be thorough, as long as water displaces some decon90).
5. Set up water pump which helps to wash the NMR tubes thoroughly

6. Ensure 5 litres of water is added to the adaptor and pumped through the tubes (in order to do this you need to empty the bottom chamber 5 times – do not load more than 1 litre before emptying the bottom chamber).

>  <mark>!WARNING!</mark> avoid getting water into the trap (this prevents water being drawn into the electric pump and thus electrical failure).

 

 

## Washing caps

7. Remove decon90 from the beaker the caps are in and Rinse the caps in another beaker thoroughly with miliQ water, preferably 7-8 times

8. After washing, dry using the air jet to dry the tubes and caps

9. After drying the tubes using the air jet, look at the tubes under light to check for dirt on the outer surface of the tubes. Clean when necessary.

10. Keep the clean tubes and caps in a dry beaker.

 

## Tube Drying 

11. Use the airflow from the piped gas line (bottom wall-mounted tap behind the ELGA water purifier). 

12. Angle the tap to ~5 o'clock to ensure the air-flow is not too vigorous.

13. Dry each tube using white lint-free tissue to recover any water droplets by upending the tube over the tube dry station to the right of sink (for 3mm tubes carefully attach a glass Pasteur pipette to the top of the drying rod using the rubber attachment provided).

14. Turn off the airflow after use.

> <mark>!WARNING!</mark> Failure to turn off the airflow prevents air compressor being available for the NMR spectrometers (for hydraulics of auto samplers and lifting/lowering samples into the magnet so this step is ESSENTIAL to maintain Facility operation.
