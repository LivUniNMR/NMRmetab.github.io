# Welcome to the NMR Metabolomics protocol portal!

## Contents
Here you can find the protocols used by the NMR Metabolomics group. Protocols are collated in following groups:

1. Sample Preparation
1. Data Acquisition
1. Data Analysis

## Usage
Inidividual protocols can be selected by expanding the categories on the left hand side.
Protocols or contents can be searched through the magnifying glass icon on the top right.

## Adding, Modifiying or Reporting.
Please contact [Rudi Grosman](mailto:r.grosman@liverpool.ac.uk "r.grosman@liverpool.ac.uk") for addition modification of protocols as well as reporting bugs.

Good luck with your experiments and remember:
> If at first you don't succeed try two more times so that your failure is statiscally significant!
