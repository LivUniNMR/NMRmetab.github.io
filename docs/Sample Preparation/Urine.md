# Urine Sample Preparation

> Collection tubes, which contain additives such as citrate and other added stabilizers should be avoided, since they give additional signals in the NMR spectra.

## Collection
- Collect ~0.8ml into plastic tubes (no additives) kept on ice. 
- Add 0.02% (final volume) NaN<sub>3</sub>.
- Transfer samples on ice (not frozen) immediately to the laboratory.

## At the lab
- Centrifuge samples at 1,600g for 5 min at 4<span>&deg;</span>C (this step may be omitted if urine known to contain no bacterial contaminants). 
- Store supernatant at –80<span>&deg;</span>C until analysed. Samples may be stored for up to 9 months (Maher, A.D., Zirah, S.F., Holmes, E. & Nicholson, J.K. Anal. Chem. 79, 5204–5211 (2007)).

## Immediately prior to NMR acquisition at 300K

- Thaw samples at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.
- Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 6000 c/min.
- To 900μl urine sample add:
  - 100μl 1M sodium phosphate pH 7.4 in 100% D<sub>2</sub>O 
  - 1μl 100mM TSP in 100% D<sub>2</sub>O 
- Vortex for 1 minute.
- Centrifuge at room temperature 13000g for 2 minutes. 
- Pipette 600ul into 5mm NMR tube (take care not to disturb and particulate pellet at the bottom of the eppendorf).
