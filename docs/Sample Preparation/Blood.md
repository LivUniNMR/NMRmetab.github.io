# Plasma and Serum

## Sample Preparation

Avoid citrate and other added stabilizers since they give additional signals in the NMR spectra. Also, collection tubes should be avoided, which use gel to separate blood cells from plasma.

### Plasma
 - Collect ~0.80 ml into Heparin coated tubes (e.g., Li-Hep monovette) to give plasma,
use standard site-specific procedures for blood collection.
### Sera
 - Collect ~0.80 ml into uncoated tubes (e.g., Serum Z monovette) stand upright until
coagulation - use standard site-specific procedures for blood collection. The time
before separation of blood cells should not exceed 30 min.
### Both
 - Centrifuge samples at 1,600g for 15 min at 4<span>&deg;</span>C.
 - Store supernatant at –80<span>&deg;</span>C until analyzed. Samples may be stored for up to 9 months [Teahan, O. et al. Anal. Chem. 78, 4307–4318 (2006)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ac051972y).



## Immediately prior to NMR acquisition at 310K

 - Add to 500μl of Plasma/Sera:
     - 100μl 1M Sodium Phosphate pH 7.4 in D<sub>2</sub>O
     - 400μl H<sub>2</sub>O
     - 2.5μl NaN<sub>3</sub> (1.2M or 8%)
 - Vortex for 1 minute.
 - Centrifuge at room temperature 13000g for 2 minutes.
 - Pipette 600μl into 5mm NMR tube (take care not to disturb and particulate pellet at the bottom of the eppendorf).

> Do not use TSP as a reference standard in plasma, serum or any other samples with a high protein content, since the compound binds to proteins resulting in a much reduced signal with a very broad line width.
