# Intracellular Metabolite Extraction

## Collection from Cell Culture

Testing has concluded that cells cultured to 90% confluence in T25 flasks (~2 x 10<sup>5</sup> ) provide suitable level of metabolite extract if each flask represents one metabolomics sample.
> Levels of metabolites may be cell line dependent –please ask for details.

 - Optional (for adhering cells): Trypsinize (6 ml trypsin solution followed by 6 ml fresh media) cells at 80-90% confluence in T25 flasks into 15ml falcon tubes.
 - Harvest cells from each flask into separate pellets by centrifugation at 1000 g for 3 minutes at 10<span>&deg;</span>C.
 - Carefully pipette off the supernatant which can then be discarded.
 - Gently resuspend each cell pellet in 1 ml Phosphate Buffered Saline pH 7.4 (PBS).
 - Transfer cell suspensions into 1.5 ml Eppendorf.
 - Centrifuge Eppendorf at 1000 g for 5 minutes at 10<span>&deg;</span>C.
 - Carefully pipette off the supernatant which can then be discarded.
 - Freeze the cells rapidly in liquid nitrogen.
 - Store cells at -80<span>&deg;</span>.

## Extraction of soluble metabolites
 - Prepare fresh ice-cold solvent solution: 50% HPLC grade acetonitrile, 50% double distilled water.

 - Add 500 μl ice-cold solvent solution into frozen Eppendorf containing pelleted cells (adjust volume for accurate weight).

 - Sonicate cells in solvent solution in Eppendorf placed in a beaker of ice using microtip (maximum frequency) in 3 x 30 second bursts to prevent heating.

 - Vortex the sample for 1 minute.

 - Centrifuge sample at 12000 g for 10 minutes at 4 <span>&deg;</span>C.

 - Collect the supernatant in clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf and lyophilise.

 - Store lyophilised material at -80 <span>&deg;</span>C until use.

## Immediately prior to NMR acquisition at 298K (to be carried out by NMR operative)

 - To lyophilised material add:
     - 178 μl 100% D2O
     - 20 μl 1mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 in 100% D2O
     - 0.2 μl 100mM TSP in 100% D2O
     - 0.2 μl 1.2mM NaN3in 100% D2O
 - Vortex for 1 minute.
 - Centrifuge at room temperature 12000 g for 2 minutes.
 - Pipette 190 μl into 3mm NMR tube (take care not to disturb and particulate pellet at the bottom of the eppendorf).
