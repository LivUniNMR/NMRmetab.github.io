# Tissue Sample Preparation – Soluble Metabolites

Author: Marie Phelan
Revision Date: 4 October 2016

Once tissue is excised it is important to keep on ice and do the initial steps as quickly as possible:

 - Keeping tissue on ice, divide tissue into ~10mg sections (accurately weighed) and place into individual 2ml Eppendorf, this procedure should not take more than 30 minutes.

 - Freeze the tissue sample rapidly in liquid nitrogen after division to immediately stop any enzymatic or chemical reactions.

 - Store tissue at -80&deg;C.

## Extraction of soluble metabolites

- Prepare fresh ice-cold solvent solution: 50% HPLC grade acetonitrile, 50% water.
>  50:50 Acetonitrile:Water buffer will select for primarily hydrophilic metabolites

- Add 100μl of solvent solution per 10mg tissue (adjust volume for accurate weight).

- Sonicate tissue using microtip (10KHz) in solvent solution in an ice bath in 3x 30 second bursts to prevent heating.

- Vortex the sample for 1 minute.

- Centrifuge sample at 12000g for 5 minutes at 4&deg;C.

- Collect the supernatant and lyophilise .

- Store lyophilised material at -80&deg;C until use.

  ## Immediately prior to NMR acquisition

  -  Add the following to lyophilised material

    - 70μl 1mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 in 100% D<sub>2</sub>O
    - 630μl H<sub>2</sub>O
    - 0.7μl 100mM TSP in 100% D<sub>2</sub>O

  - Vortex for 1 minute.

  - Centrifuge at room temperature 12000g for 2 minutes.

  - Pipette 600μl into 5mm NMR tube (take care not to disturb and particulate pellet at the bottom of the Eppendorf).

    

 > The typical sample size is 20 mg (wet mass) although in theory as little as 5 mg can be used. Homogenisation can be achieved via multiple methods with varying success dependent on amount and properties of tissue under study so please discuss optimisation process with us in advance.
