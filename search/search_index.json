Also, collection tubes should be avoided, which use gel to separate blood cells from plasma. Plasma Collect ~0.80 ml into Heparin coated tubes (e.g., Li-Hep monovette) to give plasma, use standard site-specific procedures for blood collection. Sera Collect ~0.80 ml into uncoated tubes (e.g., Serum Z monovette) stand upright until coagulation - use standard site-specific procedures for blood collection. The time before separation of blood cells should not exceed 30 min. Both Centrifuge samples at 1,600g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0 C. Store supernatant at \u201380 \u00b0 C until analyzed. Samples may be stored for up to 9 months Teahan, O. et al. Anal. Chem. 78, 4307\u20134318 (2006) . Immediately prior to NMR acquisition at 310K Add to 500\u03bcl of Plasma/Sera: 100\u03bcl 1M Sodium Phosphate pH 7.4 in D 2 O 400\u03bcl H 2 O 2.5\u03bcl NaN 3 (1.2M or 8%) Vortex for 1 minute. Centrifuge at room temperature 13000g for 2 minutes. Pipette 600\u03bcl into 5mm NMR tube (take care not to disturb and particulate pellet at the bottom of the eppendorf). Do not use TSP as a reference standard in plasma, serum or any other samples with a high protein content, since the compound binds to proteins resulting in a much reduced signal with a very broad line width.","title":"Plasma and Serum"},{"location":"Sample%20Preparation/Blood/#plasma-and-serum","text":"","title":"Plasma and Serum"},{"location":"Sample%20Preparation/Blood/#sample-preparation","text":"Avoid citrate and other added stabilizers since they give additional signals in the NMR spectra.
