Software may also be used as 'evaluation' which allows metabolite identification but you cannot save your results. All licensed versions enable saving and the professional version allows import and build of new molecules for the library. Book the appropriate hot-desk as required: METAB4 Chenomx Professional METAB1 Chenomx Standard METAB2 Chenomx Standard Chenomx works ideally with spectra acquired at 25\u00b0C and around 7.0 pH. 1) Launch Chenomx Launch Chenomx from the desktop icon or the panel shortcut (select profiler if prompted): When launched Chenomx will ask for a licenses (on METAB3, TD, LNX7 and LNX6). Click on Evaluate . The software launches with a message offering the option to analyse a sample spectrum. Click on \u2018No\u2019. 2) Opening a spectrum in Chenomx On the menubar click on File and select Open to proceed to the open dialogue. NMR spectra (Bruker format) are saved in a file called \u201c1r\u201d which are typically located in a nested file directory structure ( replace pink text with relevant information ): /home/ [USER NAME] /data/ [DATA NAME] /nmr/ [EXPERIMENT NUMBER] /pdata/1/1r and click \u2018Open\u2019. 3) Calibrate & Process spectra An import screen will request sample details in order to calibrate the built-in metabolite library for analysis. \u200b Calibration: \u200b In most biofluids (not blood, SF or CSF) samples will have an internal standard (Chemical Shape Indicator (CSI) in Chenomx). The most common standard is TSP, but this may be different in certain cases. Refer to the sample preparation documents if unsure. \u200b Once selected enter the final concentration of the standard TSP in the sample. This information will be used for identification and quantification of metabolites. \u200b Uncheck the \u201cSample contains one or more pH Indicators\u201d box and enter the sample pH value (7.4) followed by +/- value for adjustment. Metabolites will have shifted signals at different pHs - this information will calibrate the shifts of metabolites for analysis. \u200b Processing: \u200b In metabolomics the spectra is automatically processed immediately after acquisition therefore no extra processing should be required (leave this unchecked). Click OK . Chenomx will now load the selected spectrum for analysis. 4) Spectrum Manipulation \u200b After the spectrum is loaded the analysis screen opens. Spectra can be scaled (y axis) up and down via scrolling mouse wheel down and up (respectively). Zoom in / out (x axis) via pressing shift + scrolling mouse wheel. 5) Tools for analysis The left hand panel provides 5 tabs to aid with analysis: Reference Card: Reference cards give information and links on selected metabolites. Compound Sets: Chenomx allows the use of in-house metabolite libraries, from this tab an in-house library may be selected (if available). Spectrum Details: Displays details of current spectrum (instrument, field strength, experiments, etc.). Legend: Provides control to work on layers of spectra, as well as to create digital spectrum via summing or subtracting spectrum digitally. Files: File browser to swap between spectrum quickly. 6) Manual Metabolite analysis To start analysis, select a metabolite from the compound list. When selected, the compound spectrum will be overlaid in blue on your sample spectrum. Dashed blue lines shows the shifts of the peaks for the selected metabolite. On the upper left corner right under the compound name. All peaks of the compound are listed and when clicked it will automatically zoom in to that region allowing finer adjustments for your analysis. 7) Automated Metabolite Analysis What makes Chenomx a faster streamlined metabolite identifier is the feature that automatically fits multiple compounds via recreating your spectrum with the built-in library through a series of algorithms (this is why upon importing it is very important to provide the correct standard (as well as its concentration) and pH value). Select the entire range of metabolites listed below the spectrum panel by clicking on the panel and typing ctrl+A . Alternatively select a subset of metabolites using the mouse and shift key (individual metabolites can be added and taken out via control+click). Right click on your selection and click on \u201cFit Automatically\u201d. After Chenomx finishes compound fitting, depending on the metabolites selected you will encounter two info messages. If metabolites were matched, Click OK and proceed to manual verification. If no compounds were matched click OK and either try another set of compounds or a different spectrum (the import options may require adjustment). 8) Automated Metabolite Analysis Appraisal Matched compounds will now be shown in bold letters in the compound list and they will also be quantified. At this point metabolite fits should be appraised. The black spectrum is your original spectrum. The red spectrum is a digitally created spectrum from the fitted compounds. Blue arrows shows the peaks of the currently selected compound (you can switch to reference card tabs to obtain more information about your compounds). On the upper left corner just below the compound name in the spectrum window there is only one value \u201c2.4\u201d which show the corresponding peak of the compound. This value can appear in two conditions: Green: The peak is fitted to the original spectrum. Black: The peak might fit but requires fine tuning. NMR provides unique characteristic spectrum for each molecule although their location on a spectrum might change slightly depending on conditions (i.e temperature, pH, other compounds in the solution) the overall fingerprint is always the same. This is why when Chenomx flags a peak that is not green it you can adjust the intensity and shift within a certain margin of error. Click the peak in question then hold down left mouse button over the blue shaded area and drag the peak to change height and or shift. For a molecule with multiple peaks the relative height volume is fixed therefore be mindful when adjusting one signal that all signals corresponding to that molecule will change. 9) Peak Matching When a compound is fitted but peaks are not matching, click on the peaks that are in black below the compound name. This will zoom in to that peak region where you can move the peak around with in the given margin. When you are out of range your peak indicator will turn red. When you fit the peak it will turn green. Some peaks may not turn green because they will under the other peaks or noise, that is why you need to verify each match given by chenomx. When you are done with your verification, select another metabolite and you will be seeing its projection on your spectrum. Here you can clearly see that NADP+ is in the spectrum but all peaks appear to be black. After adjustment even though all the peaks are not green the fit is clear and the metabolite is identified.","title":"Chenomx Profiler Metabolite Identification - Quick Guide"},{"location":"Data%20Analysis/Data%20Annotation/Chenomx%20Profiler/#chenomx-profiler-metabolite-identification-quick-guide","text":"Author: Rudi Grosman & Marie Phenlan Revision Date: 2 November 2017 Chenomx is a commercial software package for which we have two 'standard' licenses and one 'professional' license.

Dr Arturas Grauslys (funded by A Jones - TRDF) has built a server-based analytical platform in the Galaxy framework that supports tools employed by MS metabolomics and proteomics as part of the COSMOS consortium. The tool aims to streamline and pipe multiple NMR metabolomics analytical modules that can then be used to reproduce analyses and visualise the data as it is manipulated. An alpha test is available within the university of Liverpool with plans to open up the server to www in Autumn 2017. One particular feature that has been useful for curration of datasets for deposition is the ability to visualise the pattern file (i.e. the bucket boundaries and their annotations) overtop the spectra. The following instructions describe how this can be done using TameNMR. Prepare NMR Spectra In order to overlay the pattern with the spectra the spectra must be converted into a recognisable format. We can use AMIX to export the spectra as a matrix of numbers but we need the narrowest bucket width possible (essentially ppm per point) to see true resolution. An alternative approach would be to export 1Ds as jcamp however this would need to be done for each spectrum individually (no way to process as a batch unlike AMIX). Open topspin and load dataset Check number of points in processed spectrum This can be found in Topspin under procPars tab SI e.g. 131072 Check the HzpPT Hertz per point \u2013 also under procPars tab e.g. 0.091699 Divide that by field strength to get ppm per point e.g. 0.091699/600.1299368=0.000153ppm per point Export Spectra as csv file Follow general bucketing protocol for AMIX however set bucket width to per point value. Launch AMIX and carry out bucketing procedure with the following options Simple rectangular buckets No scaling Sum of intensities Set bucket widths to 0.000153 (or whatever value was calculated in 1.) Export bucket table as csv with: Tab separations Spectra in columns Upload csv spectra file to galaxy Galaxy server can be accessed from anywhere within the University (or via VPN). Open galaxy in browser: galaxy.liv.ac.uk Go to Get Data (Left hand) Upload File (can drag and drop into upload window) Leave type as Auto-detect and click Start Wait for it to upload (this may take some time \u2013 worth carrying out analysis on SUBSET of spectra) Upload Patter file Upload the Bruker format pattern file The pattern file is a Bruker formatted text file containing the bucket boundaries and their annotations for the dataset. Go to Get Data (Left hand) Upload File (can drag and drop into upload window) Leave type as Auto-detect and click Start Now convert data with Import data tab Prepare pattern file Source \u2013 bruker pattern file Bruker pattern file - use pattern file Click execute Upload the bruker format pattern file The Bruker formatted text file containing the bucket boundaries and their annotations can be converted into a 3 column (tab separated) csv file and thus used directly in Galaxy without import/conversion. The 3 columns must be left bound (in ppm), right bound (in ppm) and annotation. Plot the Overlay Provided actions 2, 3 and 4 yielded no errors (red crosses on the right hand pane) the pattern and spectra may now be plotted in Galaxy. Be aware that the visualisation zoom is fixed therefore it is recommended to plot 1 to 2ppm ranges of spectra to be able to see the annotations effectively. Also the height of the spectra are auto-scaled to maximum peak in visualisation range (so avoid plotting water or large peaks when trying to observed peaks near the baseline.

Dr Arturas Grauslys (funded by A Jones - TRDF) has built a server-based analytical platform in the Galaxy framework that supports tools employed by MS metabolomics and proteomics as part of the COSMOS consortium. The tool aims to streamline and pipe multiple NMR metabolomics analytical modules that can then be used to reproduce analyses and visualise the data as it is manipulated. An alpha test is available within the university of Liverpool with plans to open up the server to www in Autumn 2017.

Some of the editing needed to make the file compatible with MetaboAnalyst involves the incorporation of some key information for the analysis, for example: Open bucket file in spreadsheet software. Add a new column after the name of each spectrum (See example spreadsheet on Metaboanalyst). The first column (name) corresponds to the sample identity kept from the spectrometer. The second column (group) contains the key information for future grouping and testing. Data check Once you have uploaded your file the data integrity check screen will appear. In this step you can decide how to deal with missing values if applicable. There is functionality to choose to ignore variables with over a percentage of samples missing or to use an algorithm to estimate those missing values. However, most of the data produced via the tools presented in this workshop will not require this step and we can click \u201cskip\u201d. Data filtering This functionality is paramount when trying to reduce dimensionality of the data for computational purposes (many variables=longer computational time) and to reduce unwanted variance, specially remove outliers. However, if you have less than 2000 variables/bucket/metabolites and you are unsure on how to filter your data, you can choose to not filter your data (\u201cnone). Normalisation Options The aim of normalisation is to make samples comparable (for example to reduce variation due to dilution effects, \u2018pipetters\u2019 or ). Some examples include normalisation by an internal standard e.g. a metabolite that is at constant concentration between treatments or If looking at a time series for example we could also normalise all other samples by the time zero. Some data transformations also aid in some analyses. For example log transformation is usually helpful in biological data that which distribution is skewed towards positive values. Each dataset is different and requires its own evaluation. Scaling is a way of making the variables in the data more similar in range. If the variables are of different scale some linear analysis methods (like PCA) will tend to be influenced more by larger variables skewing the results. Pareto scaling is a popular choice in metabolomics studies and is available in MetaboAnalyst. When you have finished, click Submit to view the data normalisation (see Figure below). After the transformations the data is centred around zero and is of similar scale, with not variables overweighting by solely their nature instead of the effect the treatments have on them. It is ready for further analysis, press next Click Submit to view the data normalisation. After the transformations the data is centred around zero and is of similar scale. It is ready for further analysis. Submit The data is now prepared for application of the numerous statistical tests available in MetaboAnalyst. Different tests are available depending on how many cohorts (GROUPS) you have. In this example there are more than Two cohorts, Thus multivariate tests such as ANOVA and available and twofold tests such as T-Test and Fold Changes are not. ## Part 2 Statistical Analysis You can now explore the statistical tests MetaboAnalyst offers. Different tests are available depending on how many cohorts (CLASS/GROUP) you have. We have >2 cohorts, so multivariate tests such as ANOVA are available but not tests for only two variables such as t-test. ## Part 2a Statistical Analysis \u2013 ANOVA Choose parameters & explore data Choose a p-value threshold Choose post hoc analysis technique (method to do cohort comparisons on significant points (both Fisher and Tukey) and correct for false positives (Tukey)). Red data points are significantly different Dotted line represents the p-value cut-off Blue data points are not significantly different Click on each data point to get a box plot showing the different in intensity of the peak at that ppm between the samples. Clicking on the table shows the post-hoc table (see next page) Click on the paint palette to download images Post-hoc tables are available from the ANOVA The Table only reports those buckets that are significantly different between cohorts, in the post-hoc tests section it can be seen between which cohorts the bucket is significantly different. Clicking on each of the buckets (1.914Lys, for example) brings up a box plot of the differences of that bucket between cohorts. The table is downloadable as well as the box plots. ## Part 2b Heat maps Heat maps are a very useful visualisation method. For a quick overview of how the groups are different between them in relation to the bucket signal. ## Part 2c Statistical Analysis \u2013 PCA To launch PCA analysis select PCA from side menu (red arrow) 1) In the Overview you can visualise your data to five principle components (PC's) with a pairwise score plot for each PC against every other PC 2) Scree plot - shows % explained variance both per PC and cumulatively 3) 2D scores plot - shows scores for annotated samples (including 95% confidence elipsoid) for specified PCs 4) 3D scores plot - shows moveable cube with 3 PCs plotted against each other. Hover mouse over each point to get specific sample information. 5) Loadings plot - shows metabolite bucket weightings responsible for specified PCs. Hover the mouse over individual point to obtain specific bucket weighting. Click on specific point to see a boxplot representation. 6) Biplot \u2013 combines sample score to most influential buckets. ## Part 2d Statistical Analysis \u2013 PLS-DA and OPLS-DA Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures (O-PLS) are supervised multivariate analyses. Similar to PCA the PLSDA algorithm can be launched by clicking the tab. The output will be akin to PCA\u2019s but with some key differences. Main similarities are the score plots of the PLS components and the loadings. Similarly than with PCA, latent variables arise that provide new projections (scores) and to which the original variables have certain contribution (loadings). Because over-fitting is a very important issue, there are main methods to try to control it implemented in MetaboAnalyst. These provide statistical insight on how many variables to choose to create the model. The algorithm implemented within MetaboAnalyst should automatically select chosen the best fit for the data. 1) Cross Validation In the cross-validation tab several parameters can be selected such as the performance measure. The optimal is set to Q 2 , which is the cross-validated sum of squares captured by the model. Another method to control over fitting is permutation test. These rely on assessing how likely is to get the separation obtained by the model randomly. For that purpose, the labels (groups/cohorts) are randomised/unordered and the model is made again. With random labels, no significant differences should be found between groups. This process is repeated iteratively 100, 1000 or 2000 times (in MetaboAnalyst) and allows deriving the probability of separating the original groups just by chance. A low p value indicates that the chances for the grouping to be random are low. 2) Importance Features In the tab \u201cImp. Features\u201d, there are two variable importance measures in PLS-DA, that can be downloaded by pressing on the little sheet icon. The first, Variable Importance in Projection (VIP), is a weighted sum of squares of the PLS loadings taking into account the amount of explained Y-variation, in each dimension this can be interpreted as a measure of the contribution or importance of a variable to the model . Since VIP scores are calculated for each component when more than 1 component are used to calculate the feature importance the average of the VIP scores are used. The other importance measure is based on the weighted sum of PLS-regression. The weights are a function of the reduction of the sums of squares across the number of PLS components. The coefficient of each feature will be different depending on which group you want to predict. The average of the feature coefficients are used as the overall coefficient-based importance. 3) OPLS-DA The last feature that has been implemented in MetaboAnalyst is OPLS. Documentation is still limited but it is note worthy the visualisation improvement that might provide with respect to PLSDA (see below, groups separation is more obvious with only two dimensions). Part 3 Modifying and extracting the data At any time the left hand menu allows modification of the dataset under investigation. Selecting upload, processing and normalisation will return to the corresponding process. Selecting Statistics opens a list of statistical analyses available in MetaboAnalyst for the particular dataset (dependent on number of groups etc.) Part 4 Download In the Download section all or part of the analysis results can be downloaded. Clicking on the Download.zip downloads everything in one zipped file. This is sometimes a good option as MetaboAnalyst will time out after a period of inactivity require re-inputting of the data. Logging out ends your session and the data will no longer be available so make sure you have downloaded everything you need before you do this.

Pareto scaling is a popular choice in metabolomics studies and is available in MetaboAnalyst. When you have finished, click Submit to view the data normalisation (see Figure below). After the transformations the data is centred around zero and is of similar scale, with not variables overweighting by solely their nature instead of the effect the treatments have on them. It is ready for further analysis, press next Click Submit to view the data normalisation. After the transformations the data is centred around zero and is of similar scale. It is ready for further analysis. Submit The data is now prepared for application of the numerous statistical tests available in MetaboAnalyst. Different tests are available depending on how many cohorts (GROUPS) you have. In this example there are more than Two cohorts, Thus multivariate tests such as ANOVA and available and twofold tests such as T-Test and Fold Changes are not. ## Part 2 Statistical Analysis You can now explore the statistical tests MetaboAnalyst offers. Different tests are available depending on how many cohorts (CLASS/GROUP) you have. We have >2 cohorts, so multivariate tests such as ANOVA are available but not tests for only two variables such as t-test. ## Part 2a Statistical Analysis \u2013 ANOVA Choose parameters & explore data Choose a p-value threshold Choose post hoc analysis technique (method to do cohort comparisons on significant points (both Fisher and Tukey) and correct for false positives (Tukey)). Red data points are significantly different Dotted line represents the p-value cut-off Blue data points are not significantly different Click on each data point to get a box plot showing the different in intensity of the peak at that ppm between the samples. Clicking on the table shows the post-hoc table (see next page) Click on the paint palette to download images Post-hoc tables are available from the ANOVA The Table only reports those buckets that are significantly different between cohorts, in the post-hoc tests section it can be seen between which cohorts the bucket is significantly different. Clicking on each of the buckets (1.914Lys, for example) brings up a box plot of the differences of that bucket between cohorts. The table is downloadable as well as the box plots. ## Part 2b Heat maps Heat maps are a very useful visualisation method. For a quick overview of how the groups are different between them in relation to the bucket signal. ## Part 2c Statistical Analysis \u2013 PCA To launch PCA analysis select PCA from side menu (red arrow) 1) In the Overview you can visualise your data to five principle components (PC's) with a pairwise score plot for each PC against every other PC 2) Scree plot - shows % explained variance both per PC and cumulatively 3) 2D scores plot - shows scores for annotated samples (including 95% confidence elipsoid) for specified PCs 4) 3D scores plot - shows moveable cube with 3 PCs plotted against each other. Hover mouse over each point to get specific sample information. 5) Loadings plot - shows metabolite bucket weightings responsible for specified PCs. Hover the mouse over individual point to obtain specific bucket weighting. Click on specific point to see a boxplot representation. 6) Biplot \u2013 combines sample score to most influential buckets. ## Part 2d Statistical Analysis \u2013 PLS-DA and OPLS-DA Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures (O-PLS) are supervised multivariate analyses. Similar to PCA the PLSDA algorithm can be launched by clicking the tab. The output will be akin to PCA\u2019s but with some key differences. Main similarities are the score plots of the PLS components and the loadings. Similarly than with PCA, latent variables arise that provide new projections (scores) and to which the original variables have certain contribution (loadings). Because over-fitting is a very important issue, there are main methods to try to control it implemented in MetaboAnalyst. These provide statistical insight on how many variables to choose to create the model. The algorithm implemented within MetaboAnalyst should automatically select chosen the best fit for the data. 1) Cross Validation In the cross-validation tab several parameters can be selected such as the performance measure. The optimal is set to Q 2 , which is the cross-validated sum of squares captured by the model. Another method to control over fitting is permutation test. These rely on assessing how likely is to get the separation obtained by the model randomly. For that purpose, the labels (groups/cohorts) are randomised/unordered and the model is made again. With random labels, no significant differences should be found between groups. This process is repeated iteratively 100, 1000 or 2000 times (in MetaboAnalyst) and allows deriving the probability of separating the original groups just by chance. A low p value indicates that the chances for the grouping to be random are low. 2) Importance Features In the tab \u201cImp. Features\u201d, there are two variable importance measures in PLS-DA, that can be downloaded by pressing on the little sheet icon. The first, Variable Importance in Projection (VIP), is a weighted sum of squares of the PLS loadings taking into account the amount of explained Y-variation, in each dimension this can be interpreted as a measure of the contribution or importance of a variable to the model . Since VIP scores are calculated for each component when more than 1 component are used to calculate the feature importance the average of the VIP scores are used. The other importance measure is based on the weighted sum of PLS-regression. The weights are a function of the reduction of the sums of squares across the number of PLS components. The coefficient of each feature will be different depending on which group you want to predict. The average of the feature coefficients are used as the overall coefficient-based importance. 3) OPLS-DA The last feature that has been implemented in MetaboAnalyst is OPLS. Documentation is still limited but it is note worthy the visualisation improvement that might provide with respect to PLSDA (see below, groups separation is more obvious with only two dimensions).","title":"Part 1 Submitting Data"},{"location":"Data%20Analysis/Statistical%20Analyses/Statistical%20Analysis%20in%20MetaboAnalyst/#part-3-modifying-and-extracting-the-data","text":"At any time the left hand menu allows modification of the dataset under investigation.
